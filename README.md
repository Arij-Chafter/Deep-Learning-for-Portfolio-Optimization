# Deep Learning for Portfolio Optimization

This project is based on the research article "Deep Learning for Portfolio Optimization" by Zihao Zhang, Stefan Zohren, and Stephen Roberts from the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance, University of Oxford.

## Overview

This project aims to implement the portfolio optimization approach described in the mentioned article. The method utilizes deep learning, specifically LSTM networks, to directly optimize the Sharpe ratio and construct a portfolio consisting of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9.7
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, etc.)
